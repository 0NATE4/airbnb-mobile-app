# Map Demo

This folder contains a minimal Expo project showcasing the map components used in the main app.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The demo renders a map with a few sample listings from `assets/sample-listings.json`.
